10 REM Dave Angel, who wrote some of the Wang BASIC microcode
20 REM and even more of the BASIC-2 microcode, says that the
30 REM Wang BASIC RND() wasn't so random.  To prove it, plot
40 REM random locations with pairs of RND() coordinates.  Some
50 REM locations never fill in, he says, but they do in BASIC-2.
60 REM So, here's a test.
70 REM

100 DIM R$64, D$17, M$1
110 INIT (09) R$: INIT (0D) D$: M$="*"
120 REM first byte of D$ is 00 to reduce effect by one
130 STR(D$,1,1)=HEX(00)
140 PRINT HEX(03):REM clear screen
150 GOSUB'1: REM draw outline
160 X=RND(1)*61+1:Y=RND(1)*14+1
170 PRINT HEX(010D0A); STR(D$,1,Y); STR(R$,1,X); M$; HEX(08);
180 GOTO 160
190 REM

2000 REM draw a box around the screen
2010 DEFFN'1
2020 PRINT HEX(01);
2030 FOR X=1 TO 63:PRINT "-";:NEXT X:PRINT
2040 FOR Y=2 TO 15
2050 PRINT HEX(86);:FOR X=2 TO 62:PRINT " ";:NEXT X:PRINT HEX(86)
2060 NEXT Y
2070 FOR X=1 TO 63:PRINT "-";:NEXT X:PRINT HEX(01);
2080 RETURN
