10 REM A version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for benchmarking; it counts
11 REM the number of prime numbers between 3 and 16384.  It is adapted from
11 REM a near infinitely long chain of derived programs that originated in
12 REM the September, 1981 Byte magazine.
13 REM The correct output is 1899 primes.

20 REM A$() contains flags indicating which numbers have divisors or not
30 REM Because we skip all even numbers, including 2, the first flag, at
40 REM array offset 1, corresponds to 3.  the second flag is 5, etc.
50 DIM A$(128)64:REM prime flags
60 DIM D$(1)1:REM one byte array
70 DIM F$(1)1:REM constant "F"

80 INIT ("T") A$():INIT ("F") F$()
90 C=0:REM number of primes
