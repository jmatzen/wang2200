These are notes on how to turn the wvdutil python scripts into a windows
executable.

On my "work" windows xp virtual machine image, I installed python2.7
so that the resulting .exe was a 32-bit executable. This way it works
for win32 and win64 machines.

Step 1: establish python environment
    * installed python 2.7 from python.org website
    * manually added c:\Python27;c:\Python27\Scripts to my %PATH%
    * pip install future
    * pip install typing
    * pip install pyinstaller  (http://www.pyinstaller.org/)

Step 2: build it
    * mkdir jim\wvdutil
    * copy (various .py to jim\wvdutil)
    * cd C:\jim\wvdutil
    * pyinstaller.exe -F wvdutil.py  (the -F says make single file bundle)
    * executable appears as jim\wvdutil\dist\wvdutil.exe
